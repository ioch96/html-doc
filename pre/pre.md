# HTML `<pre>` Tag

The `<pre>` tag defines preformatted text.

Text in a `<pre>` element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The pre element</h1>
    <pre>
    Text in a pre element
    is displayed in a fixed-width
    font, and it preserves
    both      spaces and
    line breaks
    </pre>
  </body>
</html>
```
