# HTML `title` Attribute

The title attribute specifies extra information about an element.

The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

The title attribute is part of the Global Attributes, and can be used on any HTML element.

Use of the title attribute in an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>Title of the document</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p><abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>
	<p title="Free Web tutorials">W3Schools.com</p>
</body>
</html>
```
