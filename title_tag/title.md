# HTML `<title>` Tag

The `<title>` tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

The `<title>` tag is required in HTML documents!

The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The `<title>` element:

- defines a title in the browser toolbar
- provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
- displays a title for the page in search-engine results

**Note**: You can NOT have more than one `<title>` element in an HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>HTML Elements Reference</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>This is a heading</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
