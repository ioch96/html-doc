# HTML `<!DOCTYPE>` Tag

All HTML documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

**Note**: The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is **NOT case sensitive**.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
