# HTML `<body>` Tag

The `<body>` tag defines the document's body.

The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

**Note**: There can only be one `<body>` element in an HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
